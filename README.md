## User Story

```md
I want to have a blog page where users can register an account, and then post tech releated blog posts. Blogs from all users will appear on the "blogs" page, where they can then be viewed in depth and comments left on them. On the user dashboard you will have the option to update or delete your existing blog posts.

```
